Please briefly describe the problem you have identified. If you are
currently enrolled in one of my classes, please post your question in Slack
instead of opening an issue here unless you are reporting a typo or suggesting
an addition to the course content.

For possible bugs with `R` code or suggestions, please include a minimal
reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a
[reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start by reading
<https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.
