# Contributing to this Lecture
Since this repository is part of a course curriculum, contributions are welcome
but may not be accepted for curricular reasons. Contributions are particularly
welcome from students in my courses in one or more of the following areas:

### Bugs
If you believe you have found a bug in either the course code or in one of
the packages, please report it in Slack before opening an issue in this
repository.

### Typos
If you have found a typo in the course materials, please open an issue and
identify where the typo is.

### Suggestions
Suggested modifications to the course content, such as items that are unclear,
key terms to add to the [`REFERENCE.md`](../references/REFERENCE.md) file,
or suggestions about additional resources that could be provided (such as links
to outside content), are all welcome. Please open an issue describing your
suggestion.

## Before Opening an Issue
Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/slu-soc5050/lecture-01/issues)
to make sure the bug or typo hasn't been reported and/or already fixed.
Similarly, search to make sure someone has not already made a suggestion. If
there is a suggestion and you want to express support for it, please comment
in the existing issue.

By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. You can
[edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)
(e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. For example, you'd simply
remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.

## Code of Conduct
Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of
