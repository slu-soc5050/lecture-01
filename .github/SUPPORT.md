# Support for Course Materials
Since this repository is part of a course curriculum, I am generally
unable to provide support to individuals who are not enrolled in my course.
If you are currently enrolled in one of my classes, please post your question in
Slack instead of opening an issue here unless you are reporting a typo or
suggesting an addition to the course content. Please check the
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines before opening an issue.
