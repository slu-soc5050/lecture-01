# lecture-01 Reference

* Function - "a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit" (via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine))
* Working directory - The root directory that is associated with a particular file or process 
    - Significance - "When the process refers to a file using a simple file name or relative path (as opposed to a file designated by a full path from a root directory), the reference is interpreted relative to the current working directory of the process." (via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory))
