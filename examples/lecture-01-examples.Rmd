## Introduction
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. We'll use notebooks throughout the semester for both demonstrating code and for assignment submission.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r test-chunk}
plot(cars)
```

## Dependencies
This notebook requires a number of pre-installed packages, including `base`, `datasets`, and `utils`. These packages are already installed and loaded each time you open `R`. In addition, there are three packages we discussed installing during class. We'll use `install.packages()` to install CRAN packages, and the `remotes` package to install packages hosted on GitHub:

```r
install.packages("cowsay")
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("chrisprener/testDriveR")
```

It is a best practice not to install packages in a notebook but rather to install them interactively via the Console. This prevents you from re-installing an updated version of the package each time you knit the notebook, potentially breaking your code.

You should update packages when you are not in the middle of an important project using:

```r
update.packages()
```

You will have to type `y` or `Y` or `Yes` at each prompt. Packages installed with `remotes` can be updated by re-executing the `remotes::install_github()` function as needed.

With those packages installed, we'll start by opening the one package that we need immediately. The `library()` function is used to open all packages: 

```{r load-packages}
library(cowsay)
```

You only need to install `R` packages once using `install.packages()` or `remotes::install_github()`. At the beginning of each session / notebook, however, you will have to load them using the `library()` function. If you get the following error message, it means you need to use the `library()` function to load the package that your function is included in:

```r
> mutate()
Error in mutate() : could not find function "mutate"
```

So, in this case, we would need to load the package that the `mutate()` function is housed in.

## Load Data
After we load any dependencies we might need, our next task is going to be to load the data that we need. For this class, that will generally mean loading data from a package, though you may have to import a data set from time to time.

Data will be imported into an "object" - a name in your "environment" (essentially, in `R`'s memory) where it is held so that it can be referenced later. For example, we could make an object named "prof" and assign my name to it:

```{r create-prof}
prof <- "Chris"
```

You should now see the `prof` object in the `Enviornment` tab in RStudio! We can enter an object name by itself in the console to print its contents:

```{r print-prof}
prof
```

We'll do the same thing this time, except we'll load some data from the `datasets` package. The `datasets` package comes pre-installed with `R` and contains a variety of fun and/or useful data sets. We'll load some data describing eruption intervals from the [Old Faithful geyser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful):

```{r create-geyser}
geyser <- faithful
```

To explore the geyser data, we can use two functions. The first, `str()` or "structure", gives us a summary of its contents:

```{r explore-geyser}
str(geyser)
```

We've got two variables - one named `eruptions` and one named `waiting`.

Next, we can use `View()` to open a spreadsheet like view of the data:

```{r view-geyser}
View(geyser)
```

You can also click on the geyser object in the `Enviornment` tab to open up the same spreadsheet view of the data.

## Working with Functions
So far, all of the functions that we have used have taken a single argument in the parentheses:

```r
install.packages("cowsay")
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("chrisprener/testDriveR")
str(geyser)
View(geyser)
```

Function calls can be made more complex in two ways. First, functions can be *nested* within each other. For instance, if we want to generate a list of the animals included in `cowsay`, we could try to print the `animals` object. It is quite messy, so I won't do it in the notebook, but you can try in the console if you'd like:

```r
animals
```

To extract just the names, we can use the `names()` function:

```{r list-names}
names(animals)
```

This is great, but it would be better if it were presented in alphabetical order, so we'll *wrap* the `names(animals)` function call in the `sort()` function:

```{r list-names-alpha}
sort(names(animals))
```

`R` functions are endlessly nestable, but you should do this with caution - the more times you nest within a function, the harder it becomes to read and de-bug!

The second way we can extend functions is by specifying multiple arguments:

```{r say-yoda}
say(what = "do or do not, there is no try", by = "yoda")
```

Parameters like `what` and `by` give a function specific pieces of information. Always name the parameters - it makes your function easier to debug and more explicit!

## Getting Help

If you want to get help from within `R`, there are two easy way to bring up documentation files in the `Help` tab in the lower right-hand corner. The first is the single question mark, which can be used with a package name:

```{r help-package}
?base
```

The single question mark can also be used with a function name:

```{r help-function}
?install.packages
```

If you don't find what you need, or a package/function does not have help files created for you, you can use the double question mark operator to search for additional resources:

```{r help-search}
??cowsay
```

## `R` Projects and Working Directories
RProjects are a special type of file associated with RStudio. They create self-contained directories and environments that increase the reproducibility of your work. They also take care of managing the working directory for you. The working directory is an often difficult to grasp concept at first. Think of it as a postal address - this is where `R` will expect all information to come from and go to about a project. You can view the current working directory with `getwd()`:

```{r check-wd}
getwd()
```

There are ways to set the working directory in the console, but we want to avoid them at all costs. Anytime we use an RProject, it will set the working directory automatically. To create a new RProject, go to `File > New > Project...`. You'll have the ability to associate your project with a new folder or with an existing folder. For this class, you'll generally want to associate it with an existing folder!
