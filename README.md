## About SOC 4015 & 5050: Quantitative Analysis
### Course Description
This course provides an introduction to applied statistical analysis with an emphasis placed on statistical techniques that are most common in the sociological literature. The statistical techniques introduced include measures of central tendency and dispersion as well as measures of bivariate association. Multivariate statistical analyses are also introduced. While the examples may be specific to the social sciences, the theories and skills that are covered are broadly applicable across academic disciplines. More details are available on the [course website](https://slu-soc5050.github.io).
